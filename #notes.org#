#+begin_src learnings
*Packages I installed* 
1. web-mode
2. company-web
3. yasnippet
4. emmet-mode
5. added hooks and set indentations and other settings in .emacs file
6. added this to .emacs file for live server functionality: 
(require 'simple-httpd)
(setq httpd-root "/Users/zintan/magali-project")
But this setq did not work so I did "M-x httpd-serve-directory" and chose the directory "/Users/zintan/magali-project"

*How to run the website from emacs*
1. Make changes to your file
2. Run M-x httpd-start
3. Open the file you want to checkout by going to http://localhost:8080/NAMEOFFILE.html

*Setting up Flask* 
Working with python and js files using flask (at this point, I am no longer using httpd)

*Communicating between python file and js file*

*Module for other people to follow*
1. Create file system with the following structure
   - project (any name - cs-resources )
       - app.py (app.py preferable)
       - templates 
           - index.html (any name)
       - static
           - script.js
2. Set up Flask in app.py (watch youtube video. link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYO6GNOJMmQ ). Be comfortable with running app on local host through flask.
   - pip install flask
3. Link app.py to script.js (Intro to JS Promises. Use the link to the blog as a resource: https://healeycodes.com/javascript/python/beginners/webdev/2019/04/11/talking-between-languages.html)
4. Import ezsheets to app.py and use it to access Google sheet. (link: https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/chapter14/)
5. Be able to display fetched information onto homepage using script.js.

6. Figure out how to deploy this app (For me)
